[ ] Develop adaptive sampling distribution for wriggle pattern
[ ] Try out if we can improve using tabu search (implemented using NN, then
distance/checkMotion with nearest)

[x] Refactor PathSection/Restriction to make sure no invalid states are used
[x] Remove all sanity checks before benchmarking! (plus disable find section analyzer)

[ ] Base Path Head Copy Constructor should make deep copy, otherwise we might
change previous header (we might not yet have noticed that because we often just
go down one direction)

Local push (sample nearby then advance using triple/corner step)
Global push (sample fiber, then advance using triple step)

[x] Fixed memory leak when calling plannerData->decouplePlanner()
[x] Refactored path restriction/find section method
