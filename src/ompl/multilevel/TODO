[x] Clean up constructor Bundle Space
[x] Organize MultiQuotient classes in better way
[x] Add QRRTStar
[x] Clean up QMPStar, make it inherit from QMP
[x] Make Bundle/Base/Fiber private, so that we have to use custom in-built
interpolate/distance/addConfiguration methods. (then we can easily add dynamical
constraints there, usable by any bundle algorithm)
[x] Move Explorer stuff from GraphSparse to Explorer
[x] Move pathVisibilityChecker to Explorer
[x] Move SPQR checks to GraphSparse
[x] make QMPStar inherit from QMP
[x] Run Benchmark Rapid Inf Test
[x] rewrite diagram to go top down (including little squares)
[x] Implement Random-Degree-Vertex sampling
[x] prettify diagram
[x] Refactor IdentifyBundleSpaceComponentType
[x] Fix memory leak on shortest path metric
[x] Add Adaptive Graph Thickening
[x] Add last Valid sampling bias after we tried a geodesic lift
[x] Add SO3xRN
[x] Merge with master branch ompl/ompl (to get newest planner versions)
[x] benchmark the whole suite on pregrasp
[x] Fix base space Nan values in hypercube benchmark
[x] Rename LiftPath to InterpolateAlongPathSection
[x] Try to fix path section interpolation by using random fiber directions
(particle shooting extension?)
[x] Fix Hypercube out_of_range error
[x] Add L1 interpolation on restriction into recursiverepair (for QRRT,
verify on Hypercube)
[x] Outsource path section shooting method to own folder
[x] Rename quotientspace folder to multilevel (when we migrated to final ompl
merge branch) 
[x] Add inverse L1 and extend box scenario
[x] What to do about velocity constraints?
[x] Think about quasi-sections (something along the lines of the best dynamical lift)
[x] Rename whole repo
[x] Add steering function support (at least SE3 and SE2)
[x] Make sure every experiment is solvable in "realtime" (around 3s)
[x] Make L1+L2 combined recursiverepair section method (Probably more
likely to find section if trying L1, L2, L1inverse instead of doing too much
sidestepping)
[x] Remove all sanitychecks/debug informations
[x] Plot hypercube benchmark (fix log to plot script)
[x] Fix possible memory leak in QRRT*
[x] Write new tutorial/demo for multilevel
[x] Redo 37dof pregrasp with ProjectionEnabled Planner (should work since RN)
[x] Further sweep to clean up SparseGraph

[ ] DOCUMENTATION: Better pictures for highlevel intro (also use fiber bundle picture)

//Possible Extensions
[ ] Remove DenseGraphPath method from BundleSpaceGraph.h
[ ] Add Enumerate for Metric/Importance/Sampler (Use Params like in RRTstar)
[ ] Refactor path restriction into dynamic/geometric
[ ] Make path bias a dynamic window (test SE3 and SE3^k)
[ ] Add projection for multiple robots to enable benchmark with projection based planners
[ ] Make bidirectional version of QRRT (as param)

Changes:
-- Paper preprint on arxiv (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09435.pdf)
-- Added license to each file
-- Clang-format run on all files
-- Add doxygen documentation 
-- Created new namespace "multilevel" (easier to handle both geometric and
control spaces)
