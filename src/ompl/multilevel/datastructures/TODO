[x] Fix path restriction feasible segment to recursive call
[x] Ensure that goal state moves inside cosntraints when using triple stepping
[x] Make interpolateAlongBasepath a member of PathRestriction (and rewrite it)
[x] Remove safety checks in addBundleEdge()
[ ] Wriggling goes too long
[ ] Do worst case analysis for pathsection method (or use PTC?)
